## How to make your Wiki

### Installation

If Wiki app is already installed and running for you, you can skip this part.

#### - Method 1 (recommended)

We recommend you to uninstall Academia app before installing Wiki app.
Make sure that you have commited all changes before uninstalling.
To uninstall, write the following command:
```bash
bench --site sitename uninstall-app academia
```

After you finish uninstalling, get and install Wiki app through the following commands
```bash
bench get-app https://github.com/frappe/wiki.git
```
```bash
bench --site sitename install-app wiki
```

Once you are done installing wiki, you can now install Academia app:
```bash
bench --site sitename install-app academia
```

#### - Method 2

If you don't want to uninstall Academia app, you can get and install Wiki app:
```bash
bench get-app https://github.com/frappe/wiki.git
```
```bash
bench --site sitename install-app wiki
```

After the first install, you might encounter an error similar to

Now, uninstall and re-install the app again:
```bash
bench --site sitename uninstall-app wiki --no-backup
```
```bash
bench --site sitename install-app wiki
```
Now things should be working fine.
If you are still encoutnering different errors, we recommend you to use the first method.


### First steps

#### - Migrate

After installing Wiki app successfully, start by migrating the data to your site.
```bash
bench --site sitename migrate
```
You should also do this everytime you pull changes from the main github repository.

#### - Delete default Wiki data

Go to the *Wiki Pages* doctype and look for the two default wiki pages named *"New Wiki Page"* and *"Home"* and delete them.

You should also go to the *Wiki Space* doctype and look for the default wiki route that has *"Wiki"* in the route column and delete it.

### Start making your Wiki

In the *Wiki Space* doctype, add a new row and in the *Route* field type the name of your project - preferably using underscore (_) instead of spaces - and then press save.

After you do that, type the route name (in this case, your project name) after the domain of your site and start making your wiki :)

```
After that you can push your changes to github and the data will be pushed with it.
