		1. Retrieves a list of Council members with their employee, member role, and user ID.
		2. Adds user permissions for the "Council" entity and the current Council's name for head and reporter.
		3. Adds the appropriate roles ("Council Head" or "Council Reporter") to the user if the role is not already assigned.
		4. Removes the user permissions and roles for any users who are no longer Head or Reporter.
